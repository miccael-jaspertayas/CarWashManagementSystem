# 🚗 Car Wash Management System

## Project Overview

This is a robust, feature-complete management system designed to handle the daily operations and administrative reporting for a car wash business. The system is built using C\# and Windows Forms, focusing on a clear, role-based user interface and secure data management.

### Key Features Implemented:

  * **Secure User Authentication:** Login with user roles, and account lockout after 3 failed attempts.
  * **Role-Based Access:** Distinct functionality and dashboard views for `ADMIN` and `EMPLOYEE` roles.
  * **Transaction Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capability for recording customer washes, services, vehicle types, and payment status.
  * **Inventory & Services Management:** Admin panels to manage available services and vehicle types.
  * **Financial Management:** Dedicated module for tracking monthly business expenses.
  * **Automated Reporting:** Calculation and display of real-time daily stats and comprehensive monthly/yearly financial reports (Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit, Employee Share, Most Popular Services/Vehicles, etc.).
  * **Auditing:** System logging of all critical actions (login, logout, user creation/status changes, CRUD operations).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

  * **Language:** C\#
  * **Framework:** .NET (Windows Forms)
  * **Architecture:** Layered (UI, Core.Managers, Core.FileHandlers, Core.Enums)
  * **Data Storage:** Local flat files (.txt, .log) storing structured text and logs for persistence.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * **Visual Studio 2022** (with the **.NET desktop development** workload installed).
  * **Windows Operating System** (Required for Windows Forms application).

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if hosted):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/miccael-jaspertayas/CarWashManagementSystem
    ```

    *(If not hosted, simply open the project folder in Visual Studio.)*

2.  **Open the Solution:**
    Open the `CarWashManagement.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Ensure the `CarWashManagement.UI` project is set as the startup project. Press **F5** to build and run the system.

### Initial Credentials

The system automatically initializes the default administrative account if no user data files are found.

| Username | Password | Role |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **admin** | **admin123** | ADMIN |

## 📂 System File Structure

The system uses flat text files stored in a dedicated directory (relative to the executable) for all persistent data.

| File | Purpose | Manager |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `users.txt` | Stores all user accounts, roles, statuses, and password hashes. | `AccountManager` |
| `transactions.txt` | Stores all records of completed and ongoing car wash services. | `TransactionManager` |
| `expenses.txt` | Stores all financial expenditures/business costs. | `ExpenseManager` |
| `services.txt` | Stores the list of available services and their prices. | `CarManager` |
| `vehicles.txt` | Stores the list of available vehicle types and base wash prices. | `CarManager` |
| `audit.txt` | Logs all critical actions (logins, password changes, user status changes). | `AuditFileHandler` |

## 👤 User Roles and Permissions

| Role | Dashboard Access | Admin Menu Access | Key Capabilities |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ADMIN** | Full | All management forms (Users, Vehicles, Services, Expenses) and Reporting. | Can activate/deactivate users, set prices, and access all financial reports. |
| **RECORDER** | Full | None (Restricted to daily operations). | Create new transactions, update transaction status, and update own password. |

## 📊 Reporting Logic

The Monthly/Yearly Report feature provides essential business intelligence:

  * **Net Profit:** Calculated as **Total Owner Share** - **Total Expenses**.
  * **Revenue Shares:** All transaction amounts are split between **Owner Share** and **Employee Share** based on rules defined in the `TransactionManager`.
  * **Historical Data:** All calculations are performed against **"Paid"** transactions only within the selected time range.
